This project is an example of algorithmic art. It creates a picture out of randomness that consists of rectangles, circles and liness with different random opacities. Because out of randomness anything can be created therefore this simple html-file beats its programmer when it comes to creativity. One sample of proof of concept product development is this bag which is based on one random picture produced with this artistic algorithm: https://www.zazzle.com/sunshine_in_rain_tote_bag-149275889259362329

The name of the html-file is quite random because it's generated from true randomness. It includes everything in html and javascript.
